The recorded weight gain of rats which are eating either grains, seeds, or fruit.

This is a measurement and can take on a variety of values within a range. It is quantitative and continuous.
The temperature in Adelaide at midday every day, recorded for 3 months.

Temperature can take on a variety of values within a given range. It is quantitative and continuous.
The brands of chocolate available at the local supermarket.

This is a categorical variable as it represents different categories or types of chocolate brands. It is not continuous.
The number of people attending a seminar on space travel.

While this is a quantitative variable, it's discrete because the number of people can only be whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.), not a continuous range of values.
The annual income of an employee recorded as: 1 = less than $30,000, 2 = greater than $30,000 but less than $50,000, 3 = greater than $50,000 but less than $100,000, 4 = greater than $100,000

This variable is ordinal and represents different income categories. It is quantitative but not continuous as it groups incomes into specific brackets.
From the descriptions provided, the following are quantitative continuous variables:

The recorded weight gain of rats which are eating either grains, seeds, or fruit.
The temperature in Adelaide at midday every day, recorded for 3 months.

From the descriptions provided, the following are categorical variables:

Species of bird in a tropical rainforest.
Seriousness of injury of arrivals at an emergency department, where 0 = no injury, 1 = minor, 2 = major, 3 = fatal.
Country of birth for players in the English national cricket team.

Here's the matching of each R function to its description:
str_detect()

find the presence or absence of a pattern in a sentence
unique()

identifies the possible entries within a column, with duplicate entries removed
facet_wrap()

split each type of variable into a separate plot
mutate()

add a new variable to a data frame whilst preserving existing variables
inspect_num()

examine the numerical variables in a data frame
inspect_na()

examine the missing data in a data frame
So, the answers are:

str_detect() → find the presence or absence of a pattern in a sentence

unique() → identifies the possible entries within a column, with duplicate entries removed

facet_wrap() → split each type of variable into a separate plot

mutate() → add a new variable to a data frame whilst preserving existing variables

inspect_num() → examine the numerical variables in a data frame

inspect_na() → examine the missing data in a data frame
4.Based on the provided histogram:

The majority of the data seems to be concentrated on the left side of the graph, with fewer data points (towns) as the percentage of people with college degrees increases. This indicates that the histogram is right-skewed.
The histogram appears to have one primary peak, which means it is unimodal.
Therefore, the correct answer choice is:

It is right-skewed and unimodal.
5.Based on the provided scatterplot:

The best description for the relationship between sleep_total on the x-axis and sleep_rem on the y-axis is:

Moderate, positive, linear.
6.Based on the provided boxplot, the median (the horizontal line within the box) of the diamond prices is highest for color "J".

10.The correct statement that is NOT true about a 95% confidence interval is:

If a sample is taken, and a confidence interval is produced, 95% of population means will fall within the confidence interval.

"Separate lines are necessary as the p-value is less than 0.05" is the correct choice if the interaction term's p-value is less than 0.05.
"Separate lines are not necessary as the p-value is greater than 0.05" is the correct choice if the interaction term's p-value is greater than 0.05.
